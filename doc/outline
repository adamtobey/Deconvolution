abstract
	* statement of the problem: a naive solution to reversing convolution operations on images is to form a linear system with weights based on the convolution of the kernel, but when an image is convoluted and then compressed, error is introduced. This error propagates throughout the solution of the system chaotically and causes the naive solution to be essentially useless.
